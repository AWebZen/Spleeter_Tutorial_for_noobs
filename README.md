# Spleeter tutorial for noobs

I just discovered [Spleeter](https://github.com/deezer/spleeter) built by Deezer, and find it to be a great tool with plenty of applications.

To help my musician friends, lacking any programming knowledge, I adapted Spleeter's Google Colab to make it usable for everyone, simply by following this tutorial. This will enable you to split songs into different instruments (basic use of Spleeter).

For more complex operations, you will have to ask a programming friend. ;)

You can find the Google Colab tutorial [**here**](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1l13q7ZO3NXesQzM58baDYRT7tOxwxPVv). 

In order to use it, click on "Save a copy to Drive" or "open in playground mode", as otherwise you will not be able to edit it.

Hope it helps!
